  <bodyContent><![CDATA[<p>Well, its been well over a month since  I got back from CodeGarden, the "infamous" yearly Umbraco developer conference in Denmark.</p>
<p>It was as every bit <em>awesome as it sounds</em>.</p>
<p>I've been using Umbraco now for around a year. I've chosen it and had to use it for the rebuild of some of our biggest websites and clients.</p>
<p>So you could say I have been heavily invested in Umbraco - but there's still some big question marks in my head about it's best practises and how should will fit into the workflow of my team as we continue to build projects with it.</p>
<p>There was one big question that alway came between our team when discussing our work flow so it's was my job for Code Garden </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How would Umbraco fit into our current CI/deployment workflow? </strong>So from a chat I had towards the end of CodeGarden seems most people do a mixture of two things; Create packages to upload the changes they have made or Use USync which is a package made by Kevin Jump which writes your Umbraco content to disk giving you something to move between environments</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a good feeling to find alot of people that suffer from the same pain we do trying to find the best solution to the age old questions  - but usually its that we're just too stupid to figure it out whats right in front of us.</p>]]></bodyContent>
